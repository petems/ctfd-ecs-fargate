# CTFd ECS Fargate Infrastructure

This repository contains Terraform infrastructure code to deploy CTFd (Capture The Flag platform) on AWS using ECS Fargate.

## Project Overview

**Objective**: Deploy a scalable, secure CTFd application on AWS ECS Fargate with supporting infrastructure including RDS database, load balancing, SSL termination, and monitoring.

**Architecture**:
```
Internet -> ALB -> ECS Fargate -> RDS MySQL
                    |
                    v
                 S3 Storage
```

#### Task 5.2: Root Configuration
- [ ] `main.tf` calling all modules with proper dependencies
- [ ] `outputs.tf` exposing key infrastructure endpoints
- [ ] Environment-specific tfvars files
- [ ] Comprehensive `README.md` for users

## Key Configuration Requirements

### CTFd Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL`: RDS connection string from Secrets Manager
- `UPLOAD_PROVIDER`: "s3" for file storage
- `AWS_S3_BUCKET`: S3 bucket name for uploads
- `AWS_S3_REGION`: AWS region
- `MAIL_SERVER`: SMTP configuration for notifications

### Resource Tagging Strategy
```hcl
common_tags = {
  Project     = "ctfd-infrastructure"
  Environment = var.environment
  ManagedBy   = "terraform"
  Owner       = var.owner
}
```

### Security Best Practices
- All traffic encrypted in transit (HTTPS, RDS encryption)
- Private subnets for application and database tiers
- Least-privilege IAM roles and policies
- Security groups with minimal required access
- Secrets managed via AWS Secrets Manager

## Dependencies & Prerequisites

### Required Tools
- AWS CLI configured with administrative permissions
- Terraform >= 1.0
- Docker (for local CTFd image building/testing)

### AWS Resources
- Domain name registered and hosted in Route53
- AWS account with appropriate service limits
- Separate S3 bucket for Terraform state (not managed by this code)

### Required AWS Permissions
- EC2, VPC, and networking services
- ECS, Fargate, and container registry
- RDS database creation and management
- IAM role and policy creation
- Route53 DNS management
- ACM certificate management
- CloudWatch logging and monitoring

## Deployment Process

### Initial Setup

#### Option A: Remote State (Recommended for Production)
1. Configure AWS CLI: `aws configure`
2. Create Terraform state bucket manually (separate from application)
3. Create `terraform.tfvars` and customize for your deployment
4. Use `backend.tf` for remote state configuration
5. Initialize Terraform: `terraform init`

#### Option B: Local State (Development/Testing Only)
1. Configure AWS CLI: `aws configure`
2. Copy `backend-local.tf.example` to `backend.tf` for local state
3. Create `terraform.tfvars` and customize for your deployment
4. Initialize Terraform: `terraform init`

**Note**: Local state should only be used for development or testing. Production deployments should always use remote state with S3 and DynamoDB for state locking.

### Deployment Commands
```bash
# Plan deployment
terraform plan

# Apply infrastructure
terraform apply

# Destroy infrastructure (when needed)
terraform destroy
```

### Validation Steps
1. Verify ECS service is running and healthy
2. Check load balancer target health
3. Validate database connectivity from ECS tasks
4. Test DNS resolution and SSL certificate
5. Verify CTFd application accessibility
6. Test file upload functionality with S3

## Critical Success Metrics

- [ ] CTFd application accessible via HTTPS on custom domain
- [ ] Database connectivity and data persistence working
- [ ] File upload functionality operational with S3
- [ ] Auto-scaling policies responding to load changes
- [ ] SSL certificate valid and auto-renewing
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting fully operational
- [ ] All AWS security best practices implemented
- [ ] Infrastructure costs within expected parameters
- [ ] Deployment process documented and reproducible

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### ECS Service Issues
- Check security group rules between ALB and ECS
- Verify ECS task has proper IAM permissions
- Review CloudWatch logs for container startup errors

### Database Connection Problems
- Validate security group rules between ECS and RDS
- Check Secrets Manager configuration
- Verify RDS instance is in correct subnet group

### Load Balancer Issues
- Confirm target group health checks are configured correctly
- Verify ALB is in public subnets with internet gateway access
- Check DNS and SSL certificate configuration

## Cost Optimization Notes

- Use Fargate Spot for development environments
- Configure appropriate RDS instance sizing
- Implement S3 Intelligent Tiering for uploaded files
- Set CloudWatch log retention policies
- Use ECR lifecycle policies to manage image storage costs

## Future Enhancements

- CI/CD pipeline integration with GitHub Actions
- Multi-environment deployment automation
- Enhanced monitoring with custom metrics
- Backup and disaster recovery automation
- Container image vulnerability scanning
- WAF integration for additional security

## Commands for Claude

When working on this project, use these common commands:

```bash
# Lint and validate Terraform code
terraform fmt -recursive
terraform validate

# Plan with specific environment
terraform plan -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars

# Check resource dependencies
terraform graph | dot -Tpng > infrastructure.png

# View current state
terraform show

# Import existing resources (if needed)
terraform import aws_vpc.main vpc-xxxxxxxxx

# Switch between local and remote state
# For local state: copy backend-local.tf.example to backend.tf
# For remote state: use the original backend.tf with S3 configuration
cp backend-local.tf.example backend.tf  # Use local state
# OR use backend.tf with S3 configuration for remote state

# Migrate from local to remote state
terraform init -migrate-state
```
